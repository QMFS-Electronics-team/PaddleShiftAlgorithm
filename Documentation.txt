Control Functions 

Control functions allow for control of hardware such as motors, and solenoid which interate
with other larger mechanical components. 


High Level Methods


void shiftControl(int shift, int biasE, int biasD);

This method helps chage gear, based on the value of int shift controls the solenoid which
controls the gear. The value 0 is for netural position, 1, is for an up shift, 2 is for a
down shift. The bias values control the speed at which the clutch is engaged. The value 
biasE is for the speed to engage the clutch for and biasD is for the speed to diengage
the clutch.



void clutchControl(int engage, int biasE, int biasD);

This method activates the clutch based on the value of engage, engage = 1 engages the clutch
engae = 0 disengages the clutch. The two bias integer values control the speed of how quickly
the clutch is to be fully engaged (biasE) or disengaged (biasD). 






Low Level Functions



void servoControl(int bias, int rotationDirection);

This method controls the servo motor. The value in bias is the speed at the servo will rotate.
The value int rotationDirection can be either 0 or 1 for clockwise and anticlockwise
respectively or to engage or disengage the clutch.



void solenoidControl(int shift);

This method controls the solenoid. The method takes the argument shift which can take 3
different values, 0, 1, 2 for netural, push (extend) and pull (retract) motions. Pushing 
is used to shift to a higher gear and pull is to shift to a lower gear.
